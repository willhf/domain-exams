## Why Master Discrete Mathematics?

Discrete mathematics trains precise reasoning. It teaches you how to define
concepts rigorously, prove claims, and reason about structure rather than
examples.

Its core ideas—including logic and Boolean algebra, graphs and trees, and
relations and recurrences—form the mathematical language of computing. They
underlie algorithms, data structures, program correctness, and complexity
analysis.

Mastery indicates readiness for advanced mathematics and theoretical computer
science. More importantly, it signals mathematical maturity: comfort with
abstraction, careful logic, and rigorous proof.

## Recommended Background

Successful study of this exam scope assumes fluency with high-school algebra
(including equations, inequalities, exponents, and logarithms), as well as a
willingness to engage with abstract, proof-based reasoning.

## Out of Scope

The following topics and modes of reasoning are not covered in this exam.  
This list is intended to clarify boundaries and help candidates focus their preparation.

- **Algorithmic and complexity-focused topics**

  - Asymptotic analysis (Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ)
  - Recurrence relations and methods for solving them
  - Dynamic programming
  - Algorithmic graph problems (e.g. shortest paths, spanning tree algorithms, flows, matchings)
  - These topics are covered in the [Algorithms & Data Structures](/exams/algorithms) exam.

- **Logic beyond the stated scope**

  - Predicate logic as a formal system
  - Inference rules and proof systems (e.g. natural deduction, sequent calculus)
  - Normal forms (CNF, DNF), satisfiability, or resolution
  - Model theory or formal semantics

- **Algebra beyond elementary discrete structures**

  - Groups, rings, and fields
  - Homomorphisms and group actions
  - Linear algebra
  - Abstract Boolean algebras

- **Graph theory beyond the listed topics**

  - Directed graphs
  - Planar graphs and planarity theorems
  - Graph isomorphism
  - Network flow, matching theory, or spectral/algebraic graph theory

- **Probability and statistics beyond finite models**

  - Continuous probability spaces
  - Probability distributions as statistical models
  - Random processes or stochastic models
  - Statistical inference or hypothesis testing

- **Additional excluded areas**
  - Cryptography
  - Automata theory, formal languages, and regular expressions
  - Digital logic or circuit design
  - Generating functions
  - Advanced number theory beyond the stated scope
