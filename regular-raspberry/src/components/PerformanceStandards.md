## Performance Standards

Results are reported as **Mastery**, **Proficiency**, **Partial**, or **Insufficient**.

Results reflect absolute performance against defined criteria, not relative ranking among candidates.

- **Mastery** — Demonstrates comprehensive and reliable command of the subject
  matter. Solutions are consistently correct, well-justified, and show strong
  understanding, with at most minor errors or omissions.
- **Proficiency** — Demonstrates substantial understanding of the subject
  matter, but with one or more non-trivial errors, gaps, or incomplete
  justifications.
- **Partial** — Demonstrates limited or uneven understanding. Some correct ideas
  or techniques are present, but significant errors or omissions prevent full
  solutions.
- **Insufficient** — Does not demonstrate adequate understanding of the subject
  matter. Solutions are largely incorrect, missing, or unsupported.
