## The Vision

Textbooks are cheap, courses are everywhere, and AI tutors are free. Access to
knowledge is no longer the bottleneck. Validation is. There is no widely
recognized way to demonstrate mastery of a subject—no matter how seriously it
was studied. Domain Exams fills that gap by providing a durable, credible mark
of achievement.

## What Domain Exams Are

Domain Exams are written examinations that assess mastery of undergraduate-level
material in mathematics and theoretical computer science. They emphasize correct
reasoning and proof-based justification, with clearly defined scope and
standards.

- **Written and proof-based** — not multiple choice.
- **Standards, not ranking** — results reflect absolute performance.
- **Depth over breadth** — each exam is narrow but rigorous.
- **Reasoning-first** — understanding over memorization.
